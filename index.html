								<h3>AOKFrames Website</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/aokframes.jpg" alt=""></span>
								<p> This <a href="https://github.com/aok8/aokFramesV3">project</a> serves as my personal website for my photography.
									A perfect combination of two things I love, coding and photography, which has also served as a fun excercise 
									to look back into frontend development and learn a new language in svelte. 
									The website can be found <a href="https://aokframes.com/">here</a>.
								<h3>Octave</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/octave.jpg" alt=""></span>
								<p> A continuation to the below Spotify Playlist Curator. I don't want to give too much away as its a work in progress, 
									but I'm very excited to be working on a <a href="https://github.com/aok8/octave">new project!</a> Most of the project planning has been completed, 
									next will be to create sprints and get to coding.</p>
								
								<h3>Spotify Playlist Curator</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/spotify.jpg" alt=""></span>
								<p>This <a href="https://github.com/aok8/SpotifyPlaylistCurator">project</a> 
									serves as a new python full appliction project for me. 
									The purpose of the app is to shorten the time it takes to add songs
									and create a well rounded playlist. Currently, the way I personally 
									fill out playlists is I look through a playlist, find a song I like,
									look through recommendations and radios, then add songs from that to the playlist,
									hopefully the songs being added relate to the genre behind the playlist. 
									This application serves to be a more streamlined way of doing this. 
									Currently, the plan is to create an app that can go through this process effectively. 
									In the future, I would like to add newer features and abilites that may be difficult 
									to complete through the spotify desktop application.
